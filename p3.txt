.TH PROJECT 3 "November 2024" "Version 1.0" "Project Manual"

.SH NAME
P3 - File Systems

.SH SYNOPSIS
The goal of this project to implement a WAD filesystem. 
The FUSE library was used to create the deamon and interface with the WAD filesystem.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS libWad
The Wad class implements the methods in the specification and has been extended to facilitate
development. The data structure used to represent the WAD filesystem is an nary-tree. 
Each instance of Wad contains the head of the nary-tree as a root member of type FsObj*.
The FsObj class represents a node in the nary-tree. As its data attributes it contains the node's:  

.IP
- name: The display name in output.
.IP
- fullname: The 8 byte name, as shown in the .wad file.
.IP
- children: Vector of FsObj pointers.
.IP
- offset: Content offset in .wad file.
.IP
- length: Content length in .wad file.
.IP
- pos: File descriptor index in file descriptor list.
.IP
- _end: Points to _END file descriptor for _START node.

.PP
On Wad::loadWad the root is initialized and the structure is built.
.PP
The FileIO class abstracts common file operations: shift, append, write, writeAtLocation.
.PP
The FileDescriptor class constructs 16 byte representation of the files.

.SS Wad
.PP
Wad(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Cannot be called directly. Reads the contents of a .wad file and sets the root member, magic, descriptorListOffset and descriptorListLength.
To build the nary-tree, a stack is used to keep track of the directory structure. When a directory is read, it is pushed to the stack.
Regex is used to determine directory type. Per each file descriptor a new FsObj is contructed and set as the child of the item on the stack.
.sp
.RE

.PP
static Wad* loadWad(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Calls Wad::Wad and returns pointer to instance.
.sp
.RE

.PP
FsObj* getPathItem(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Starting from root, traverses and returns the FsObj pointed by the path.
.sp
.RE

.PP
bool isDirectory(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Checks for path validity then uses Wad::getPathItem and calls FsObj::isDirectory for that node.
.sp
.RE

.PP
bool isContent(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Negation of Wad::isDirectory.
.sp
.RE

.PP
int getSize(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Uses Wad::getPathItem and calls FsObj::getLength for that node.
.sp
.RE

.PP
int getContents(const string &path, char *buffer, int length, int offset);
.RS
.IP
Uses Wad::getPathItem to get node's offset and length information. Performs basic checks. Reads contents to buffer. Returns content size.
.sp
.RE

.PP
int getDirectory(const string &path, vector<string> *directory);
.RS
.IP
Uses Wad::getPathItem to get node. Fills *directory with node's children.
.sp
.RE        

.PP
void createDirectory(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Normalizes path. Checks for directory exitance.If directory does not exists and 
name is valid, tokenizes path and searches for parent directory.
If parent directoy is root or namespace directory it creates a file
descriptor and writes the changes to the wad filesystem. Updates header accordingly.
If successful, uses Wad::reloadWad to rebuild structure from .wad file. 
.sp
.RE        

.PP
void createFile(const string &path);
.RS
.IP
Normalizes path. If name is valid, tokenizes path and searches
for parent directory. If parent directoy is root or namespace directory,
it creates a file descriptor and writes the changes to the wad filesystem. 
Updates header accordingly. If successful, uses Wad::reloadWad to rebuild structure from .wad file. 
.sp
.RE        

.PP
int writeToFile(const string &path, const char *buffer, int length, int offset = 0);
.RS
.IP
Normalizes path. Checks for name validity of new file's name.
If name is valid and file is emtpy. It shifts descriptorListOffset by 
the length and writes contents. Updates header accordingly. If successful, 
uses Wad::reloadWad to rebuild structure from .wad file. 
.sp
.RE        

.SS FsObj
.PP
FsObj(const string &name, const string &fullname, int offset, int length, int pos);
.RS
.IP
FsObj constructor, has default constructor also.
.sp
.RE

.PP
void appendChild(FsObj* child);
.RS
.IP
Appends child to nodes children vector.
.sp
.RE

.PP
bool isDirectory();
.RS
.IP
Uses both name and fullname agains regex to determine by name if the node is a directory.
.sp
.RE

.PP
void setEnd(int _end);
.RS
.IP
Sets namespace _START node's _end member to the index of _END in descriptor list.
_end is used to position items before _END on item creation since no FsObj is created
per _END.
.sp
.RE

.PP
void clear();
.RS
.IP
Frees memory of all decendants of the node.
.sp
.RE

.PP
void clearChildren();
.RS
.IP
Used on Wad::reload to clear root's children vector after root->clear.
.sp
.RE

.PP
void traverse(bool root = false, string prev = "");
.RS
.IP
Used for debugging. Prints the directory structure from node with respect 
to its decendants.
.sp
.RE


.TP
.B
FSObj contains getters for all properties mentioned above.

.SS wadfs
Initializes deamon and implements the getattr, mknod, mkdir, read, write, readdir fuse_operations.
All implementation methods use fuse_get_context()->private_data to access Wad instance created on
deamon initialization.

.PP
static int wad_write(const char *path, const char *buffer, size_t size, off_t offset, struct fuse_file_info *info);
.RS
.IP
Implements .write. Passes all arguments to Wad::writeToFile.
.sp
.RE

.PP
static int wad_mknod(const char *path, mode_t mode, dev_t rdev);
.RS
.IP
Implements .mknod. Passes path to Wad::createFile.
.sp
.RE

.PP
static int wad_mkdir(const char *path, mode_t mode);
.RS
.IP
Implements .mkdir. Passes path to Wad::createDirectory;
.sp
.RE

.PP
static int wad_readdir(const char *path, void *buffer, fuse_fill_dir_t filler, off_t offset, struct fuse_file_info *fi) {
.RS
.IP
Implements .readdir. Fills buffer with parent and current directory. Passes path to
Wad::getDirectory and uses the method to retrive the children for the given path. Fills 
buffer with children name's.
.sp
.RE

.PP
static int wad_read(const char *path, char *buffer, size_t size, off_t offset, struct fuse_file_info *fi);
.RS
.IP
Implements .read. Passes all arguments to Wad::getContents.
.sp
.RE

.PP
static int wad_getattr(const char *path, struct stat *stbuf);
.RS
.IP
Checks if path is a file or a directory. Sets the file descriptor type, link, time, and size accordingly. 
Grants full permission to each by appending 0777 flag.
.sp
.RE

.PP
.SH TESTING
.IP
Testing was performed both manually and automatically with the test suite provided. A additional 
shell script was built to ensure correct packing and unpacking of deliverable. The script
runs the exact commands specified on the document and then runs test suite provided.

In the deamon we implemented getattr, mknod, mkdir, read, write, readdir.
.IP
nano was used to test mknod and write.
.IP
ls -al was used to test getattr setting proper permissions and readdir displaying the correct directories and files.
.IP
mkdir was used to test mkdir.
.IP
cat was used to test read.
